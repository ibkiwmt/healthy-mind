        Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell) is a kindhearted radio executive who wants to be the best possible 
        stepfather to his wife's (Linda Cardellini) two children. When her freewheeling ex-husband, Dusty 
        (Mark Wahlberg), breezes back into town, Brad's feeling of insecurity quickly develops into an inferiority 
        complex. As Dusty demonstrates his flair for athletics, home repair and bad-boy charisma, Whitaker finds 
        himself in a no-holds-barred battle to one-up his rival and win the approval of his family.
