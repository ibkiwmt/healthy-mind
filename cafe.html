     <h1>Less And More Coffee</h1>
     <section class="two-col">
     <div class="img-left"><img src="images/lessmore.jpg"/></div>
     <div class="para-right">This is not a typical "grab a drink and sit down" type of cafe. But they serve fantastic beverages 
        that donâ€™t really see around! My favorites are the Ube latte and Tiramisu latte. Humans are not only 
        visitors but also dogs visit and get treats. The owner and other workers are very friendly and passionate 
        as a barista. </div>
